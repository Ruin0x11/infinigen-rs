# infinigen-rs
A Rust interface for supporting the creation and serialization of infinite chunked terrain, like Minecraft.

Allows for packing of groups of chunk data into regions and automatic loading/unloading. Region file handles are cached, allowing for better I/O performance.

# Example
Go to `example` and do `cargo run` to run the example.

It's experimental and will probably corrupt everything. Use with caution.
